Heartbeat Harmony is a visually stunning, single-page web application designed as a romantic and nostalgic gesture. The core of the experience is an interactive, animated vinyl record set against a retro-themed backdrop. The page prominently features the message 'Your heartbeat is my soundtrack' with a neon, glitchy aesthetic. When the user clicks the spinning vinyl, they are redirected to a special song on YouTube.
